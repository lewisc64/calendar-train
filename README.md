# Calendar Train

http://lewisc64.github.io/calendar-train

Weird train style readout for basic iCal events.

## Proxy

If the calendar URL is blocked by CORS, the page will look for a proxy server on localhost:8080, and shall bosh the url in the path. Like: `http://localhost:8080/http://example.com/john.ical`.

A node proxy server can be found in the folder "proxy".
